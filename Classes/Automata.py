"""
This class is used to hold the data structure that represents an Automata.
The transition table is stored in the Automata.transition variable as a dictionary and has the following organization:
transition = {
    state_name: {
        symbol1: list()
        symbol2: list()
    } 
}

That means:
    from each state, each symbol from the alphabet leads to a subset of the state set represented by a list.
    The automata is deterministic if the size of each subset is at maximum 1 and Îµ is not in the alphabet.
